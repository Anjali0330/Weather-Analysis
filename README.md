# Weather Data Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of weather conditions using Python, pandas, and matplotlib. The analysis covers data cleaning, summary statistics, filtering, and visualization of key weather parameters.

## Dataset

- **File:** `1. Weather Data.csv`
- **Description:** Contains time-series weather data with columns such as temperature, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather condition.

## Features

- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Frequency analysis of different weather conditions
- Calculation of summary statistics (mean, variance)
- Filtering data based on specific weather criteria
- Visualization of temperature trends over time
- Pie chart representation of weather condition frequencies

## Notebooks

The main analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook:
- `analysis.ipynb`

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - (Jupyter Notebook if running interactively)
3. Place `1. Weather Data.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the notebook and run the cells in order.

## Example Visualizations

- **Line Graph:** Temperature variation over time
- **Pie Chart:** Percentage distribution of common weather conditions

## Results

- Identified the most frequent weather conditions.
- Calculated average temperature, wind speed, and visibility.
- Visualized key trends and distributions in the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to perform basic exploratory data analysis on weather data, including data cleaning, filtering, and visualization. The insights gained can serve as a foundation for further analysis, such as predictive modeling or deeper statistical exploration.
